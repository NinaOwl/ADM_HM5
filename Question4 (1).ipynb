    "A number n of kids are in a camp. Between some k pairs of them (a kid can be part of more than one pairs) there are often fights. At night there are two dormitories where the kids can sleep. We want, if possible, to assign each kid in one of the two dormitories in such a way that each pair of kids that fights often is assigned to a different dormitory. (There are no space problems and the two dormitories can have different number of kids.)\n",

    "As an input we have $k$ pairs of child that fight and n name all of children. Let's treat $n$ names of children as $n$ nodes  of graph and $k$ pairs as pairs of nodes which connected by edges. This will be our graph G. Then the question \"if it is possible, to assign each kid in one of the two dormitories in such a way that each pair of kids that fights often is assigned to a different dormitory\" is equal to the question \"is it possible to assign to each noed of graph G value of 1 or 0, so that every two connected nodes have diffrent values\". To check it, we can run DFS from each node, but each time when we will go to the nodes connected to the previous node ($v$) we will assign them another value than have $v$. If the node already has assigned colur and it's equal to value of $v$, than the answer is impossible. If we are able to finish DFS from each node without such situation, than its possible, as we have assign 0 and 1 values to all nodes, and every node connected to nodes with different values. Let's implement the algorithm."

    "First step to create adj list from k pairs it takes $O(2*k)$, as for each k pair we add element to two nodes' lists. Then we start to run DFS_value for all nodes. As we run it only if we haven't previously run it for this node (visit = 0), then we run DFS_value one time for each node, that adds O(N) (DFS, excludes recurcive calls takes O(1)). So the total complexity is O(N+k), which is linear of N and k."
